Data mining methods like market basket analysis are used to identify relationships between datasets. Our system will thus create association rules between itemsets using either the Apriori algorithm, the FP Growth method, or the ECLAT (Equivalence Class Transformation)
algorithm in order to design a system for client buying habits of shopping malls,
marts, etc. All of these solutions will be compared, and the one with the highest
accuracy will be put into practice
